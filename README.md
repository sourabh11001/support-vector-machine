# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification using Python

This project demonstrates how **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification** can be used to classify data by maximizing the margin between different classes. SVM is a powerful and versatile algorithm that works well for both linear and non-linear classification using different kernel functions.

---

## 🔍 Objective
To implement and evaluate an **SVM Classifier** that predicts class labels based on optimal hyperplane separation.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy**, **Pandas** – data preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – visualizations  
- **Scikit-learn** – SVM model implementation and evaluation  

---

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Exploration** – inspect and understand dataset structure  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – scaling, cleaning, encoding  
3. **Model Training** – train an SVM classifier with appropriate kernel  
4. **Prediction** – classify test samples  
5. **Evaluation** – Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report  
6. **Visualization** – plot decision boundaries (if dataset allows)

---

## 📈 Results
The SVM model successfully classifies the data by finding the optimal decision boundary. Using kernel functions like RBF improves non-linear classification performance significantly.

## 🚀 Key Learnings
- Understanding the concept of **hyperplanes** and **margins**  
- Role of **kernel functions** (linear, polynomial, RBF)  
- Importance of **feature scaling** for SVMs  
- Evaluating classification models using proper metrics
